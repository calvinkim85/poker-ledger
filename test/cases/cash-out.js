/* Early cash-out. From the guides' own diagnosis: a player who leaves at 11pm is one
   of the two commonest causes of a broken count — they take their money and their
   chips go back in the tray BEFORE anyone records the figure.

   The site described that failure and gave no way to avoid it. Marking a player
   cashed out locks their number, blocks accidental rebuys, and makes it obvious at a
   glance who is still playing. */
