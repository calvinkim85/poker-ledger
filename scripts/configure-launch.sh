# domain later is the same script again with the third argument, and GitHub Pages
# redirects the old URLs so indexing carries over rather than restarting.
#
# Touches: every .html page, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and CNAME when a domain is given.
# Re-running re-points everything, because it rewrites whatever host is currently in
# the canonical tags rather than assuming the original one.
